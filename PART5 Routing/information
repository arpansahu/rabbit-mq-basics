For routing we use direct exchange

Then there is concept of bindings (which are keys and tells which queue)
multiple consumers can have same bindings
these bindings are passed via producers along with the messages


We can also route using Topix Exchange
which does not used binding key but it  must be a list of words delimited by dots

users.europe.payments
users.europe.* (anything)
users.europe.
users.# (it can be anything or nothing doesnt matter after users.)

* (star) can substitute for exactly one word.
# (hash) can substitute for zero or more words.
